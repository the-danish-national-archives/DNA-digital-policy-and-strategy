# Digital Archiving Policy and Digital Preservation Strategy
The Danish National Archives (DNA) have reworked their policy and strategy for digital archiving and preservation. The documents have been developed in cooperation with external stakeholders and they will be used both internally and externally for communicating why and how the DNA archve data for posterity.

The policy lays out a set of principles to guide DNA in development of preservation solutions for digitally created data and decision making. Cooperation on preservation solutions are key to the fulfillment of the strategy's "areas of action" so that they materialise in a way and to an extent, which are tailored to the needs of our designated community. Therefore, it is important for stakeholders such as data producers, solution providers and archival users to access these documents to enable future cooperation on the joint mission to preserve our digital heritage.
