# Digital Archiving Policy and Digital Preservation Strategy
The Danish National Archives have reworked their policy and strategy for digital archiving and preservation. The documents have been developed in cooperation with external partners and they will be used both internally and externally for communicating why and how the DNA practice archving of data for posterity.

The policy composes a set of beacons which are to guide us in our development of preservation solutions for digitally created data and our decision making. Cooperation on solutions is key to the fulfillment of the strategy's areas of action so that they materialise in a way and to an extent, which are tailored to the needs of our designated community. Therefore, it is important for data producers, providers and archival users to access these documents for the future cooperation on this joint task to preserve our digital heritage.
